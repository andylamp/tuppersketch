# TupperSketch

This is an application that is designed to allow the user to draw a bitmap on the top grid and then
using Jeff Tupper's self-referential formula draw it in the bottom grid. Each offset value (k) is then
presented in the page.

The application (obviously) also allows the drawing of the formula itself (the offset k is hardcoded).

The code is fairly tested... so no (significant) problems/bugs are expected... but you never know.
